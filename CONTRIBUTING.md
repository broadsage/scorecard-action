### Release Process

This project uses automated releases with semantic-release:

- **Commits**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format

**Creating a Release:**

1. Ensure all changes are merged to `main`
2. Push commits using conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
